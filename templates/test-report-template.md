## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report presents fire flow test results conducted in accordance with **NFPA 291 - Recommended Practice for Fire Flow Testing and Marking of Hydrants**. Testing was performed by a licensed Water Distribution Operator with 15+ years of municipal experience to assess available water supply for fire protection purposes.

### Test Summary
- **Total Hydrants Tested:** [INSERT NUMBER]
- **Testing Standard:** NFPA 291
- **Test Date(s):** [INSERT DATES]
- **Weather Conditions:** [INSERT CONDITIONS]
- **Overall Compliance:** [INSERT RESULT]

## METHODOLOGY (NFPA 291)

### Testing Procedure
All testing was conducted following NFPA 291 recommended practices:

1. **Pre-Test Inspection**
   - Visual inspection of hydrant condition
   - Verification of outlet configuration
   - Documentation of hydrant identification

2. **Static Pressure Measurement**
   - Measurement taken with no flow conditions
   - Calibrated pressure gauge accuracy: ¬±0.5% FS

3. **Flow Testing**
   - Flow measured using calibrated pitot gauge and diffuser
   - Multiple outlet configuration as required
   - Residual pressure monitored at source hydrant

4. **NFPA 291 Flow Calculation**
   - Available flow at 20 PSI calculated using standard formula:
   - **Q‚ÇÇ = Q‚ÇÅ √ó [(P‚ÇÅ - 20)/(P‚ÇÅ - P‚ÇÇ)]^0.54**
   - Where: Q‚ÇÅ = measured flow, P‚ÇÅ = static pressure, P‚ÇÇ = residual pressure
