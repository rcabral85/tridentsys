# NFPA Standards for Fire Flow Testing - Trident Systems Reference

## Primary Standards for Fire Flow Testing

### NFPA 291 - Fire Flow Testing and Marking of Hydrants
**The Foundation Standard for Our Testing Methodology**

- **Purpose**: Establishes standardized procedures for fire flow testing and hydrant marking
- **Key Requirements**: 
  - Minimum 250 GPM for residential areas
  - 1000+ GPM for commercial properties  
  - 20 PSI residual pressure benchmark
  - Color-coded hydrant marking system
- **Trident Systems Application**: All our tests follow NFPA 291 methodology for consistent, defensible results

### NFPA 1142 - Water Supplies for Rural Fire Fighting
- **Purpose**: Water supply requirements for areas without municipal systems
- **Requirements**: Minimum 500 GPM for 2 hours duration
- **Application**: Rural property development and cottage country assessments

### NFPA 13 - Sprinkler System Installation
- **Purpose**: Automatic sprinkler system design requirements
- **Connection**: Relies on accurate fire flow data for hydraulic calculations
- **Application**: Our test results feed directly into sprinkler system design

### NFPA 20 - Fire Protection Pumps
- **Purpose**: Fire pump installation and testing standards
- **Requirements**: Annual flow testing and performance verification
- **Application**: Pump system design and acceptance testing

### NFPA 24 - Private Fire Service Mains
- **Purpose**: Private fire main installation standards
- **Requirements**: Hydrostatic testing at 200 PSI for 2 hours
- **Application**: New development and infrastructure projects

## Fire Flow Calculation Method (NFPA 291)

### Standard Test Procedure
1. **Static Pressure Measurement** - No flow condition
2. **Flowing Pressure Measurement** - During test flow
3. **Flow Rate Measurement** - GPM through calibrated outlet
4. **20 PSI Calculation** - Extrapolated available flow

### Sample Calculation
```
Location: Milton Commercial Plaza
Static Pressure: 72 PSI
Residual Pressure: 48 PSI
Measured Flow: 950 GPM

Pressure Drop: 72 - 48 = 24 PSI
Flow at 20 PSI: 950 × ((72-20)/24)^0.54 = 1,442 GPM

Result: GOOD - Suitable for commercial applications
```

## NFPA Compliance Classifications

### Flow Rate Categories (Typical)
- **Excellent (≥1,500 GPM)**: Large commercial/industrial facilities
- **Good (1,000-1,499 GPM)**: Most commercial applications  
- **Adequate (500-999 GPM)**: Residential and light commercial
- **Deficient (<500 GPM)**: Requires system improvements

### Hydrant Color Coding (NFPA 291 Guidance)
- **Blue**: ≥1,500 GPM (Class AA)
- **Green**: 1,000-1,499 GPM (Class A) 
- **Orange**: 500-999 GPM (Class B)
- **Red**: <500 GPM (Class C)

## Why NFPA Standards Matter for Your Project

### Legal & Insurance Compliance
- Municipal bylaws reference NFPA standards
- Building code fire protection requirements
- Insurance policy compliance verification
- Due diligence demonstration

### Safety Assurance
- Validates adequate water supply for emergencies
- Identifies system deficiencies before they matter
- Ensures reliable fire protection capacity

### Professional Standards
- Consistent, repeatable testing methodology
- Industry-recognized benchmark criteria
- Defensible results for regulatory review

### Risk Management
- Reduces liability exposure
- Prevents inadequate fire protection scenarios
- Supports infrastructure planning decisions
